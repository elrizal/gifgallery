# Give a Gif!
What started out as an experiment with [Giphy](https://giphy.com)'s API turned into a sample of an ecommerce site. Inspired by the brightly-colored yet organized card-views of entertainment sites like Buzzfeed, this page gives a brief yet memorable experience for the user looking to burn some time. 

## Technologies Used
* jQuery for dynamic UI interaction 
* Node JS & Express for the server
* [Materialize](https://materialize.com) with custom edits to its UI
* [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for effects 

So there you go! Follow the site and get cracking on a few minutes of amusing gifs scavenged from the internet.
